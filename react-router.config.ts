  // only the root module in the payload. On a site whose entire value is
  // SEO-correct static HTML that is a silent catastrophe, and it looks fine in
  // a browser, because the client renders the real page a moment later.

  // navigation would 404 against it. This site has thirteen routes, so there is
  // nothing to gain from discovering them lazily anyway.
